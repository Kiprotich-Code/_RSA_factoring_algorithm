# About

-> RSA is an assymetric cryptographic algorithm, which uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. This repository provides an executable 'factors' that factorises many integers in the shortest time possible.

# How To Run

-> The executable 'factors' takes one more arguments. Assuming your numbers are stored in a file called 'test01' found in the 'tests' folder, to get the desired output run;

./factors /tests/test01
